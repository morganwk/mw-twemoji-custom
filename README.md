# Custom Twemoji
## By Morgan Wable

Here's a repository for all of my custom Twemoji-style emotes, primarily for discord. All of the files contained herein are CC0 Public Domain. I use Illustrator so the source files will be .ai - but I can start uploading .svg files as well if requested.

Currently, this is just one bundle of 20 assorted pride flag emoji, in the general visual language as the vanilla Twemoji flags. Feel free to add 'em to your servers. I plan on creating more and adding them here periodically.
